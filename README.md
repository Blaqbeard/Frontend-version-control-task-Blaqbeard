# story-print

A tiny Node.js CLI that prints a short story chapter. This repo is used to demonstrate Git workflows for Task 4.

## Usage

```bash
node index.js                # prints Chapter 0
CHAPTER=3 node index.js      # prints Chapter 3 (if exists)
```

## Purpose

- Provides a safe, text-only codebase to practice Git branching, rebasing, merging, reverting, and cherry-picking.
- Each chapter will be added on its own branch and merged via pull requests.

Proof: Updated wording.
